### The CertiPlonk verification framework

The CertiPlonk is a framework for extracting and formally verifying constraint systems from the [Plonky3 zkDSL](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3) using the [Lean proof assistant](https://lean-lang.org/).
We have produced
1. A [fork of Plonky3](https://github.com/NethermindEth/Plonky3) that uses a symbolic air builder to extract constraint systems from Plonky3.
2. A [model of Plonky3 AIRs](https://github.com/NethermindEth/LeanZKCircuit-Plonky3) that acts as a basis for verifying the extracted circuits.
3. A [tactic](https://github.com/NethermindEth/FF_CVC5_Lean) for automatically proving goals over finite fields, by extracting the relevant goal and assumptions into CVC5's FF theory and reconstructing the resulting Gr√∂bner basis reduction in Lean.
